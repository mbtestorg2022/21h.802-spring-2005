Class attendance is mandatory. I will take attendance each week; students who miss more than one class session will fail the subject. Students must come prepared to discuss each week's assignments. Students will complete ten homework assignments, due as indicated on the syllabus. Class presentations, in groups of two and three students, will be due in class on Lecture 9. Instructions for the homework assignments and class presentations will be distributed later in the term. There will also be a map quiz and a comprehensive final exam.

Statement on Cheating and Plagiarism
------------------------------------

The web now hosts many sites which offer college-level papers of varying quality on a variety of topics. I am well acquainted with these sites, and with others that offer detection services to professors. **Buying a paper and submitting it as your own work is cheating. Copying sections from someone elseâ€™s print or online work into your own without an acknowledgement is plagiarism.** MIT has strict policies against both activities that I will enforce. For the appropriate MIT definitions and policies, visit the following websites. If you are uncertain about what constitutes cheating or plagiarism, please contact me **before** submitting the work in question.
